# Subtheme Sentiment Analysis
## Overview
This repository contains the solution for the Subtheme Sentiment Analysis task as part of the Oriserve Intern Data Scientist Assignment. The task involves identifying subthemes and their respective sentiments from a given text review.

Task Description
Given a sample text review, the objective is to develop an approach to identify subthemes along with their respective sentiments. For example:

Review:

"One tyre went missing, so there was a delay to get the two tyres fitted. The way garage dealt with it was fantastic."

Subthemes and Sentiments:

Incorrect tyres sent: Negative
Garage service: Positive
Wait time: Negative
Evaluation Metrics
The task will be evaluated based on:

Approach
Summary
The approach involves the following steps:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the text data for analysis.
Subtheme Extraction: Identifying key aspects and problems from the review.
Sentiment Analysis: Determining the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) for each subtheme.
Evaluation: Assessing the accuracy and efficiency of the approach.
Methodology
Data Preprocessing:

Tokenization: Splitting text into individual words or phrases.
Stopword Removal: Removing common words that do not contribute to sentiment (e.g., "and", "the").
Lemmatization: Reducing words to their base form.
Subtheme Extraction:

Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to identify key aspects and problems in the review text.
Employing a combination of rule-based and machine learning approaches to accurately extract subthemes.
Sentiment Analysis:

Implementing a sentiment analysis model to determine the sentiment of each extracted subtheme.
Using pre-trained models such as VADER or fine-tuning a BERT model for sentiment classification.
Evaluation:

Calculating precision, recall, and F1-score to measure the performance of the model.
Analyzing results and identifying areas for improvement.
Improvements and Shortcomings
Improvements:

Integrating more advanced NLP models for better accuracy.
Expanding the dataset for training to improve model robustness.
Implementing a feedback loop for continuous model improvement.
Shortcomings:

Limited data may affect the model's ability to generalize.
Potential misclassification of sentiments in complex sentences.
