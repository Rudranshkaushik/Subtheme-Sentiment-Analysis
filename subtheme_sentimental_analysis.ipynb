Work done and was given paperwork. Wheels dirty - but as expected- Left for work and steering wheel off-centre when going straight- Got to work and checked values on paperwork. Rear out of alignment and before/after figures unchanged- Left work early and returned to garage. Told rear not adjustable and the only way to do it is to fit new parts- Arranged to bring car back next day to sort steering- Rang Audi to ask about part required etc. and was told that all settings ARE adjustable by any competent garage, both front AND rear- Went to another wheel alignment place and asked them to confirm. They put car on ramp and within 30 seconds said the same and they didn't even need any specialist tools etc.- Took more time off work to return to A&S as agreed. Told them my findings re adjustment and they said they would sort it along with the off-centre steering wheel- When finished told \"all done\" - given no paperwork. Asked for printout and once received checked it whilst there. Rear STILL not adjusted- Asked for an explanation. Wasn't given one but told I would need to bring it back AGAIN- I then went on ~100 mile journey on which someone almost drove into me. I checked the dash cam. Found out it had been moved to point at the sky. Reviewed the footage and it was an employee at A&S that moved it prior to taking the car for a drive - I can only assume he wanted to drive it like he stole it- Cleaned car at the weekend afterwards and the gunk that was on the wheels was actually all over - especially one. Was also stuck on like glue. Took some fairly abrasive wheel cleaner and a lot of effort to remove- Checked the pressures of the new tyres - they had been set too high - higher than the maximum load pressures indicated on the car itselfIn summary, DON’T use this garage if you value your vehicle, time, money or safety.\"\"\"\n","predicted_subtheme, predicted_sentiment = predict_subtheme_and_sentiment(new_review)\n","print(f\"Review: {new_review}\")\n","print(f\"Predicted Subtheme: {predicted_subtheme}\")\n","print(f\"Predicted Sentiment: {predicted_sentiment}\")\n","# print(subtheme_classes)\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"tPS8ovCDTBbE","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1717845947349,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":1102,"user":{"displayName":"Rudransh Kaushik","userId":"14343193494312434257"}},"outputId":"12d81519-7b63-4400-8281-730a84b993db"},"execution_count":32,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Review: This is not a review of [REDACTED].com as such but my experience of the garage booked through them (A&S MOT Ltd).A terrible experience meaning I will never use A&S MOT Ltd again.

Reviewed the footage and it was an employee at A&S that moved it prior to taking the car for a drive - I can only assume he wanted to drive it like he stole it- Cleaned car at the weekend afterwards and the gunk that was on the wheels was actually all over - especially one. Was also stuck on like glue. Took some fairly abrasive wheel cleaner and a lot of effort to remove- Checked the pressures of the new tyres - they had been set too high - higher than the maximum load pressures indicated on the car itselfIn summary, DON’T use this garage if you value your vehicle, time, money or safety.\n","Predicted Subtheme: garage service\n","Predicted Sentiment: negative\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import os\n","\n","# Directory to save the models and tokenizer\n","save_directory_subtheme = '/content/drive/MyDrive/oriserve_assignment/saved_model_subtheme2'\n","save_directory_sentiment = '/content/drive/MyDrive/oriserve_assignment/saved_model_sentiment2'\n","\n","# Create directories if they don't exist\n","if not os.path.exists(save_directory_subtheme):\n","    os.makedirs(save_directory_subtheme)\n","if not os.path.exists(save_directory_sentiment):\n","    os.makedirs(save_directory_sentiment)\n","\n","# Save the subtheme classification model\n","model_subtheme.save_pretrained(save_directory_subtheme)\n","tokenizer.save_pretrained(save_directory_subtheme)\n","\n","# Save the sentiment classification model\n","model_sentiment.save_pretrained(save_directory_sentiment)\n","tokenizer.save_pretrained(save_directory_sentiment)\n","\n","print(f\"Subtheme classification model and tokenizer saved to {save_directory_subtheme}\")\n","print(f\"Sentiment classification model and tokenizer saved to {save_directory_sentiment}\")\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"M-YnPe7-acdX","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1717846033439,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":16141,"user":{"displayName":"Rudransh Kaushik","userId":"14343193494312434257"}},"outputId":"456c37bf-e35a-4add-b7b8-b9a2537f34bd"},"execution_count":34,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Subtheme classification model and tokenizer saved to /content/drive/MyDrive/oriserve_assignment/saved_model_subtheme2\n","Sentiment classification model and tokenizer saved to /content/drive/MyDrive/oriserve_assignment/saved_model_sentiment2\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from transformers import BertTokenizer, TFBertForSequenceClassification\n","import tensorflow as tf\n","\n","# Directory where the models and tokenizer are saved\n","save_directory_subtheme = '/content/drive/MyDrive/oriserve_assignment/saved_model_subtheme'\n","save_directory_sentiment = '/content/drive/MyDrive/oriserve_assignment/saved_model_sentiment'\n","\n","# Load the tokenizer and models\n","tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained(save_directory_subtheme)\n","model_subtheme = TFBertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(save_directory_subtheme)\n","model_sentiment = TFBertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(save_directory_sentiment)\n","\n","# Define the actual classes used during training\n","subtheme_classes = [\n","    \"Cheapest\", \"Garage was quick & efficient with fitting of\", \"Great garage fitted\",\n","    \"ability to browse through various makes of tyres before making a\",\n","    \"and an excellent service from the garage who fitted the\",\n","    \"and both times have been good\", \"cheaper than anything else I have found by some\",\n","    \"clean reception area and free\", \"easily navigable web\",\n","    \"easy to browse selection of tyres before making a\",\n","    \"faster than dealerships to arrange supply and partnership with ATS works well\",\n","    \"fitting took a long\", \"good\", \"good local fitting\",\n","    \"good range and competitive prices on\", \"great\", \"hassle\",\n","    \"it feels more transparent than buying from a mechanic based on their\",\n","    \"keep it up!
